# Modified osu skins
I have included the original skin and the skin that I've modified from the original.  
  
## First 2 files  
The first 2 files are the original skin.  The first one in rar format and the second one in osk format.  Download whichever is preferable.  
I love the original skin, especially for the fact that the circles are black and white and that there are no other colours that get in the way for distraction.  
  
## Last 2 files  
The last 2 files are the original files that I modified.  I just took out some assets of the skin and added my own to them.  Most of the original skin is still there though.  
Again, a rar and osk file are provided for however you want to download them.  
Feel free to do whatever sort of editing you want with the zip file, just don't claim it as your skin lol.
