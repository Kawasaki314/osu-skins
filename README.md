# Modified osu skins
The first file is the original skin that I used to play with.  It's my favourite skin since the circles are only black and white and there's no other colour for distraction.
The second file is the rar file of the skin that I modified.
The third file is the exact same as the second file but it's the osk file to make it easier for people who just want to insert the skin straight into the game.
Feel free to do whatever sort of editing you want with the zip file, just don't claim it as your skin lol.
